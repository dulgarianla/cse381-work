## Part 1

1. What is an Algorithm?
        
        An algorithm is a set of instructions that a computer can follow to complete a particular task, much like a recipe. Certain patterns emerge when these instructions are converted into code. Programming languages differ in their syntax, or the way instructions are expressed. Both the language and the structure of a program affect its speed; certain languages support short, understandable code, while others require longer instructions. Error control procedures and the kinds of data structures that are employed also differ. The programming language determines how code is organized, and built-in tools can make this process easier. Because different programming languages have different techniques, it might be difficult to achieve consistency because of these unique features. Even yet, when dealing with different programming languages, it is important to realize that the language selection has a big influence on how a program looks and works.

2. How to determine the run time performance of an algorithm? 

        When assessing an algorithm's runtime performance, different approaches provide insight into how well these algorithms manage different amounts of data. An important technique for estimating how an algorithm's speed changes with increased data is Big O notation. The second approach is theoretical analysis, in which we investigate the program and construct pseudocode. Experimental analysis is an extra method that helps to understand the program's performance by testing it with various forms of input. By using tools to pinpoint the parts of the program that take a long time, we can better understand how the program behaves. To put it simply, taking into account these complex variables offers a comprehensive understanding of how a program functions in various contexts.


3. Compare and contrast the performance of the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) shortest path, the Dijkstra shortest path, and the Bellman-Ford shortest path. In your discussion consider what happens to performance for very sparse or very dense graphs.

        The Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Shortest Path, Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm, and the Bellman-Ford Shortest Path Algorithm. Efficient programming and ordering are notably used by DAG Shortest Path for directed acyclic graphs. Dijkstra's Algorithm performs best in graphs with non-negative weights because it makes use of a priority queue inside a greedy strategy. The Bellman-Ford algorithm, on the other hand, works better on graphs with negative weights because it utilizes an edge that can accommodate cycles, even negative ones. On the other hand, Bellman-Ford can handle negative weights, whereas Dijkstra cannot, and DAG Shortest Path assumes non-negative weights. Various graph-specific standards determine the time complexities of these algorithms: With a time-based complexity of O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges, DAG is intended for acyclic networks. When Dijkstra's approach is used with a priority queue, its time complexity is O((V + E) * log(V)), and it performs well in situations involving non-negative weighted graphs. On the other hand, Bellman-Ford, with an O(V * E) time complexity, shows that it can handle negative weights and cycles with ease. Dijkstra's algorithm performs well in sparse graphs, although Bellman-Ford might perform better in graphs with negative weights. DAG Shortest Path is useful in some situations and has an O(V + E) time complexity when applied to acyclic graphs. The graph's fundamental characteristics, such as density, cycles, and negative weights, all have an impact on the method of choosing in addition to the time complexities of each approach.
